##########Known Bug List and Updates Needed

•	When I click the zero yaw button when using USB it does not completely zero. I'm not sure if we need to do something different in the hardware to make this better.
•	We need to add user instruction to show how to use the software.

######### Wish List

•	Integrate SF2.
•	gyro drift compensation change the time component to the navX time base.
•	Make the library easily installable in the FIRST WPI Menu.
•	We need to add a NavX Micro vi that only allows the operator to us USB 1, USB 2 or I2C On-Board options.
•	Add the additional information to the serial information. "t" command. We will need to address the Strict Type Def "Z900_navX_DeviceRegisters.ctl" to make it so we can have the indexes match the resolution for the new system. Most of the indexes are set for two. We need to have indexes that have four steps between them.

########## COMPLETE
2016 October 27
	Current Version is NavX Library 3.00 - This is the first launch of the software version tracking system with Tim Easterling as developer.

•	Added the action engine model to make the software easier to use. This is why this version of the library is called NavX AE.
•	Added polymorphic vi to place on main diagram. This allows the operator to choose what format they want to use to run the NavX hardware.
•	Added the ability to run two devices easily just by updating the device number.
•	Added USB support.
•	Rebuilt the examples to run with the new system.
•	Reformatted the library to allow for easy integration into the FIRST WPI menu so the VI will show up in the tool palette on LabVIEW.
•	Removed older versions of the NavX library to make code support easier.
•	Built a test window feature so the developrs can see what is going on with the hardware.
•	The serial and USB were not initilizing correctly on start up. I changed the way the system initializes.
•	Changed CRC to warning because throwing an error was making the coms reset.
•	Removed offsets display and action enigne from the software.
•	We had an I2C write error when I tried to use the WPI I2C read. It has one extra connection that allows for the I2C Register to connect. This was causing a problem with communication and causing the navX board to hang. I removed the I2C Write from the diagram and replaced it with i2clib_write.vi which does not have the input for the I2C Register. THis fixed the communication problems.
